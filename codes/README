The files generate_relative_occupancies.py, missing_stations.py, 
parse_raw_data.py, parse_station_caps.py, and  remove_duplicate_trips.py
are all used to preprocess the raw trip data from Capital Bikeshare.

Most of it is hardcoded for that particular dataset, namely the trip
data from Q4 2010 to Q1 2014. Additional data from Capital or diff-
erent data from another company will require augmentation. 

hidden_broken_set_difference.py should be almost totally irrelevant 
for anyone using this codebase. It was written to help track down
a long forgotten bug. It is being left for the sake of posterity.
